# AI-Powered-Student-Attention-Monitoring-System
This project develops an AI-powered system to monitor and detect student engagement in real-time using computer vision and deep learning techniques. By analyzing facial expressions and postures from images or live webcam feeds, the model classifies students as attentive (engaged) or inattentive (not engaged).
